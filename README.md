🏨📊Hospitality Performance Dashboard
This repository showcases a hospitality performance dashboard developed using Microsoft Excel to analyze and track overall business performance through structured data analysis and visualization. The project involves cleaning and organizing raw data, creating calculated columns and measures, and designing meaningful KPIs to represent key performance indicators. The dashboard includes interactive slicers, filters, and dynamic charts that allow users to explore trends, compare performance across different categories, and derive actionable insights. The objective of this project is to present complex data in a clear, visually intuitive, and business-friendly format that supports effective decision-making and performance.

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard by connecting to a SQL database using the ODBC connector. Data was cleaned and transformed using Power Query, including handling null values, correcting data types, and creating calculated columns. I built an optimized data model with proper relationships and created KPIs using DAX such as total revenue, booking trends, and occupancy rate. The dashboard includes KPI cards, column and line charts, and slicers with dynamic filtering. I also focused on professional formatting and performance optimization to deliver clear, actionable business insights.
